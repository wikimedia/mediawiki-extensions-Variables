=== git era Changelog ===

Please note that the git era changelog isn't complete regarding internal adjustments.
Only things that are major architecture change or might break compatibility with MediaWiki
versions and other extensions is collected here.

; TBC: v2.6.0, by MGChecker and â€¦
* Fix further template caching issues
** Template caching could mess up resetting Variables via repeated template calls.
   This won't happen anymore, as the parser frame is marked as volatile by the extension.
** This new behavior can be deactivated by setting '$egVariablesAreVolatile' to false,
   however be aware that this is a temporary option for transition and will be removed in
   the future.

; 2019-07-11: v2.5.2, by MGChecker
* Removal of PHP entry point, use wfLoadExtension( 'Variables' ) instead

; 2019-03-09: v2.5.1, by MGChecker
* Moving hook functions to separate VariablesHooks class (T202412)
* Moving code files into includes/ directory
* Renaming files to match class name

; 2018-08-30: v2.5.0, by MGChecker
* Fix '#varexists' parsing (T202679)
** if and else value are no longer expanded if not needed, thus variable definitions can be
   done conditionally and making the parser faster

; 2018-08-24: v2.4.1, by MGChecker
* Class attributes of ExtVariables changed to private, as it has been annotated before.

; 2018-04-20: v2.4.0, by MGChecker
* Fix longstanding template caching issues (T191574)
** Template caching could mess up definition of Variables depending on other Variables in
   templates, if they are called multiple times. This won't happen anymore, as the parser
   frame is marked as volatile by the extension.
** This new behavior can be deactivated by setting '$egVariablesAreVolatile' to false,
   however be aware that this is a temporary option for transition and will be removed in
   the future.

; 2018-01-23: v2.3.0 by MGChecker
* Conversion to Extension registration (T173625)
* ExtVariables::VERSION is deprecated, use Extension registration instead [1]

** Removal of InternalParseBeforeLinks hook

=== svn era Changelog ===

; 2010-11-16: v2.0 by Daniel Werner
* Version 2.0 almost is a complete rewrite of the extension, just the idea remains the
  same. It's the attempt to get rid of several bugs caused by the fact that MediaWiki
  is using several Parser objects. Therefore in v2 each Parser has its own Variables
  store, so nothing will get mixed up anymore. Full compatibility is given, except perhaps
  in cases where bugs were used intentionally.

** New features and bugfixes:
*** Inclusion of special pages in the middle of the page won't reset all defined
    variables anymore.
*** Variables should now be compatible with all other extensions, except for those still
    using Parser::parse() recursively in any way (which should never be done!).
*** For MW 1.12 and later, '#var' default value no longer gets expanded when not needed.
*** Experimental new function '#var_final' which allows to insert the variables final
    (last) value after page processing is almost through.
*** Global configuration variable '$egVariablesDisabledFunctions' added.

** Internal changes:
*** Parser class member $mExtVariables now contains an instance of ExtVariables where
    only variables for that parser are getting stored. They won't be deleted by other
    Parser actions anymore (e.g. special page inclusion doesn't reset variables anymore)
*** ExtVariables class now has public functions which should be used by other extensions
    for getting and setting variables information.
*** Removed global '$wgExtVariables' variable.
*** 'Variables_Settings.php' file for configuration settings added.

** Others:
*** Put under 'ISC License' (public domain before).
*** In case you are using Extension:Loops, you should update it as well to remain compatibility.


; 2011-11-14: v1.3.1.1 (re-pack of 1.3.1 tagged version for svn)
* Although 1.4 is released already and 2.0 in the trunk, ensure one last version
  compatible with MW < 1.12 still is available
* Some comments cleaned, 'RELEASE-NOTES' and 'README' files added.


; 2011-11-13: v1.4 by Daniel Werner
* Cleanup for use with more current MW versions:
** 'ParserFirstCallInit' hook in use and no more global extension functions.
** State of the Art internationalization files added.
* Dropped support for MW before 1.12
* 'ExtVariables::VARIABLES' constant with version info added.
* Put into mediawiki.org svn, 'RELEASE-NOTES' and 'README' files added.
